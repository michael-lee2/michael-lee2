Hi, I'm Michael Lee. I currently attend Western University for Business, but have always had an interest in coding and took computer science courses throughout high school.
I've worked with C++, Java, Python and VBA in the past.

I'm looking to pursue passion projects that combine my knowledge of business or other interests with my (albeit developing) coding ability. 

In the past I've developed basic stock screening tools that present data from Yahoo Finance and use sentiment analysis from Twitter. 
Currently I'm interested in machine learning and have some knowledge of the PyTorch library, and used it over the summer to train an agent to successfully operate within my 
PacMan inspired game.

I plan on building my knowledge base further and utilizing it for more business focused applications.

Cheers,

Michael Lee
